## Virtual-Air-Canvas
Writing is an essential mode of communication that enables individuals to express their thoughts. On-air writing has garnered significant interest in the fields of augmented reality, computer vision, and gesture recognition. The Air Canvas software is an innovative solution that combines augmented reality and computer vision to facilitate on-air writing and painting. The software introduces a digital touch screen that can recognize finger motion and interpret human gestures through mathematical algorithms. Moreover, the project includes a virtual mouse that enables users to operate essential functions such as move, click, and double-click. By making hand gestures with the index finger and little finger open, users can activate the Air Canvas window and draw or paint on it virtually, using their hand as a virtual mouse. The integration of augmented reality and computer vision in the Air Canvas software provides an exciting area of research in the fields of mechanization and human-machine interaction. This project has the potential to enhance the user's ability to express their thoughts through writing and painting and ameliorate the interaction between humans and machines in various systems.


### How it works?
The training data is clustered, and then I determined which model works best for each cluster.To make a prediction, we first determine which cluster the new data points are a part of, and then we use the trained model to make the prediction.
